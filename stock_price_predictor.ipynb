        "\n",
        "This interactive Google Colab notebook provides a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of stock market data. It goes beyond a simple script to demonstrate advanced data analysis, feature engineering, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:\n",
        "- **Interactive Widgets**: Easily select a stock ticker and date range without modifying the code.\n",
        "- **Advanced Data Analysis**: Visualize key metrics like historical price trends and moving averages.\n",
        "- **Deep Learning Model**: Build and train a sophisticated LSTM model, a type of neural network well-suited for time-series data.\n",
        "- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using standard metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
