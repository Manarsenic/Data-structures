# ðŸ“‚ Linked Lists in C

This section contains various types of Linked List implementations in C.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Learn

- âœ… Singly Linked List
- âœ… Doubly Linked List
- âœ… Circular Linked List
- âœ… Important operations:
  - Insertion (at beginning, middle, end)
  - Deletion (by value, position)
  - Traversal
  - Reversal
  - Searching

## ðŸ§  Why Learn Linked Lists?

Linked Lists are dynamic data structures where each element points to the next. They help in:
- Efficient insertion/deletion
- Memory flexibility (no fixed size like arrays)
- Forming the basis of more advanced structures like stacks, queues, graphs

## ðŸ“‚ Structure (Coming Soon)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `singly_linked_list.c` | Basic singly linked list with insert, delete, traverse |
| `doubly_linked_list.c` | Doubly linked list with forward and backward links |
| `circular_linked_list.c` | Circular form where last node links back to the head |

Stay tuned for implementations ðŸš€
