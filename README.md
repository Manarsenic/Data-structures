# Data Structures in C

A collection of classic data structures implemented in C for foundational learning and practice.

---

### Currently working on:

- **Status**: [Singly Linked List is complete!](https://github.com/Manarsenic/Data-structures/tree/main/linked_lists)

---

### ðŸ“‹ Topics Covered

The following topics represent the data structures and algorithms I have implemented in this repository.

- [x] **Pointers in C**: Basic pointer usage, arithmetic, and memory management.
- [x] **Arrays (1D & 2D)**: Implementations of single and multi-dimensional arrays, including pointer arithmetic and passing arrays to functions.
- [x] **Sorting Algorithms**: Hands-on implementations of classic sorting methods including Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, and Radix Sort.
- [x] **Searching Algorithms**: Implementations of fundamental search techniques like Linear, Binary, and Interpolation Search.
- [x] **Linked Lists(As of now only SLL)**: A dedicated project covering the implementation of Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked lists with all core operations.
- [ ] **Stacks & Queues**: Implementations of these fundamental linear data structures and their applications.
- [ ] **Trees & Graphs**: Projects on non-linear data structures, including binary search trees, heaps, and graph traversal algorithms.

### ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

The repository is organized by topic, with each major data structure and algorithm set residing in its own dedicated folder for clarity and ease of navigation.

- `/linked_lists`: Contains the complete project for linked lists.
- `/arrays`: Houses implementations related to array manipulations.
- `/pointers`: Includes examples demonstrating pointer concepts.
